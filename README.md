# Speak & Spell in Elm

My very first attempt at [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), to test my understanding and my learning with ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action).

Why Speak & Spell? Because there was room for a good mix of UI/UX. It seemed like a great starting point to learn and practice. Moreover, I fancied creating completely from scratch. As opposed to basing my learning on pre-existing concepts or to-do apps.

Being a *toy project* (no pun intended), this is a limited reproduction of the original game:

1) match the word on the screen
2) use the commands.

No *Mystery Word* or other play modes from the original Speak & Spell.

The point of this exercise was to: study, internalize, apply, learn some more, improve skills and code, rinse and repeat. Not to be an 1:1 clone.

When I first started this project, I hadn't finished the book yet. In fact, I started it right after finishing Chapter 5: all the basics up to testing. I needed to internalize the concepts I had learned up to that point, and to make sure I was getting them right.

After some time, improving my skills on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/gacallea), and doing some exploring, I have:

- migrated the project to [my template](https://github.com/gacallea/elm_vite_tailwind_template).
- migrated from [Elm UI](https://github.com/gacallea/elm_speakandspell/tree/elm_ui_version) to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- made it fully reponsive to the best of my abilities.
- resumed the book from where I left off: Chapter 6: Testing
- wrote [all tests](https://github.com/gacallea/elm_speakandspell/blob/main/tests/SpeakAndSpellTest.elm) to make of the API and of various UI items.

With all testing complete, the project fully served its purpose and it is now complete. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
