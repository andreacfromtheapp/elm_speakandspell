# Speak & Spell in Elm

My very first attempt at an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) application, to test my
understanding of [Elm in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action).

## BROKEN API UPDATE (20231023)

The Random Word API I used for this app is justifiably returning an error, most
likely because the many requests would cost them money. They invite users to
self-deploy. If you intend to check my Speak And Spell Elm implementation, you
need to deploy the API first, and then point a clone of this very app to it.

- API repo:
  [https://github.com/mcnaveen/random-words-api](https://github.com/mcnaveen/random-words-api)
- API URLs need changing in [main.js](./src/js/main.js#L19-L23) and
  [SpeakAndSpell.elm](./src/elm/SpeakAndSpell.elm#L154)

## Why Speak & Spell?

Because there was potential for a good mix of UI and UX. It seemed like a great
starting point to learn and practice. Moreover, I fancied creating a project
completely from scratch, as opposed to pre-existing concepts.

## Is it a clone?

Being a _toy project_ (no pun intended), this is a limited reproduction:

1. match the word on the screen
2. use the commands

No _Mystery Word_ or any other play mode from the original game.

The point of this exercise was to: study, internalize, apply, learn some more,
improve skills and code, rinse and repeat. Not to be an 1:1 clone.

## Some Background

When I first started this project, I hadn't finished the book yet. In fact, I
started creating this project right after finishing Chapter 5: a chapter that
covered all the basics up to testing. I needed to internalize the concepts I had
learned up to that point, and to make sure I was getting them right.

After improving my skills on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/gacallea),
and doing some more exploring, I have:

- migrated the project to
  [my template](https://github.com/gacallea/elm_vite_tailwind_template)
- migrated from
  [Elm UI](https://github.com/gacallea/elm_speakandspell/tree/elm_ui_version) to
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- made it fully reponsive to the best of my abilities
- resumed the book from where I left off: Chapter 6 - Testing
- wrote
  [all tests](https://github.com/gacallea/elm_speakandspell/blob/main/tests/SpeakAndSpellTest.elm)
  for the API and more relevant UI items

With all testing complete, the project fully served its purpose and it is now
complete. 🎉 🎉 🎉
