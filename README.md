# Speak & Spell in Elm

This is my very first attempt at an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app. I'm doing this to test my understanding of Elm and my learning with ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action). I didnâ€™t finish the book yet and I could not resist trying to apply what I've learned so far.

I picked Speak & Spell because it's a good mix of UI/UX and as a starting point to learn and practice. It will never be more than a simple exercise. A good "*first project*" kinda thing.

The code certainly stinks, a lot. Iâ€™m well aware that it needs more love and that I could improve it. Which is the point of this exercise: study, internalize, apply, learn some more, improve skills and code, rinse and repeat.
