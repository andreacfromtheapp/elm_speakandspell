# Speak & Spell in Elm

This is my very first attempt at an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app. I'm doing this to test my understanding of Elm and of my learning with ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action). I haven't finish the book yet and I could not resist trying to apply what I've learned so far.

I picked Speak & Spell because it's a good mix of UI/UX and it makes for a great starting point to learn and practice. It will never be more than a simple "*first project*" exercise. Being a *toy project* (no pun intended), it won't have too many features. I'll make it good enough to learn, and move on to resume my Elm learning path.

The code certainly stinks, and Iâ€™m aware that it needs more love and that there is room for improvement. That's the point of this exercise: study, internalize, apply, learn some more, improve skills and code, rinse and repeat.

## Try it

Don't want to [install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/)? Paste [Main.elm](./src/Main.elm) and [index.html](./index.html) on [Ellie App](https://ellie-app.com/new) to run it in your browser.

## TODO

- [x] stateful logic ðŸ¥³
  - [x] make [Impossible States Impossible](https://sporto.github.io/elm-patterns/basic/impossible-states.html) ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
- [x] [boolean identity crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TDKHGtAxeg) avoided (type Sound) ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³
- [x] keyboard
  - [x] display keyboard onscreen
  - [x] onclick events to output
  - [x] onclick events to sound
  - [x] use an [package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Gizra/elm-keyboard-event/latest/) to get user typing
  - [x] get keycode from typing into onscreen keyboard
  - [x] filter out KeyPressed to
    - [x] if alt/meta/shift/ctrl/repeat is pressed do nothing
    - [x] allow alphabet characters
    - [x] allow commands keyboard shortcuts
      - [x] ~~**FIX**: Sumbit It keyboard shortcut doesn't use the right word~~
    - [x] send keycode to screen (see "user feedback" section)
    - [x] send keycode to speak (see "user feedback" section)
- [x] text to speech ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
  - [x] [SpeechSynthesis Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) with a JavaScript Port
  - [x] let user disable voice
    - [x] completely
    - [x] ~~for some features~~ **(no. API only pauses/resumes global state)**
      - [x] ~~just keys~~
      - [x] ~~just feedback~~
  - [x] no need for Sub (for now?)
- [x] refactor ```update``` and use helper functions
  - [x] reuse helper functions to streamline code
  - [x] declutter view's onClick events and use update for Msg
  - [x] not all Msg need to be parametrized
---
- [x] now using a type Output with a case
  - [x] much clearer and less convoluted code
  - [x] it can either be Info (init text), Word, or Result upon sumbit
- [x] ~~use a Maybe String for model.click to~~
  - [x] ~~show default message or GuessWord~~
  - [x] ~~implement a conditional to only show GuessWord if valid~~
  - [x] ~~awlays show clicked Nothing if GuessWord is empty~~
---
- [x] output screen
  - [x] has user started entering a word?
    - [x] no: display default messasge telling the user what to do
    - [x] yes: display typed text
  - [x] erase letter: if guess word is emtpy display default message
  - [x] retry/reset: display default message
  - [x] submit: result text to take over as the only text on screen

### UI/UX

- [ ] vanilla CSS? SASS? PostCSS? elm-css? elm-ui? or even SVG?!?
- [ ] [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) accessibility
- [ ] responsive design
  - [ ] mobile first
  - [ ] no onscreen keyboard on mobile
- [ ] loosely look like Speak & Spell (make it look & feel like a toy)
  - [ ] keys (vowels, consonants, commands) to look different
  - [ ] use random emojis in lieu of the Elm logo?
- [ ] user feedback
  - [x] feedback for keypresses
    - [x] written feedback
    - [x] auditory feedback with SpeechSynthesis
    - [ ] visual feedback (CSS animations?)
  - [x] feedback upon checking the spelling
    - [x] written feedback
    - [x] auditory feedback
    - [ ] visual feedback (CSS animations?)
- [ ] screen
  - [ ] retro-looking/low-fi/8bit
  - [ ] expandable "side loading screen" for the description?
  - [ ] expandable "bottom loading screen" for the help section
    - [x] help toggle in Elm (temporary. exercise more than anything)
  - [ ] fixed "field" for the user output
  - [ ] separate help and commands section

### Improvements

- [ ] should I use a Maybe KeyboardEvent?
- [ ] refactor ```Msg``` and split into ```KeyPressed``` + ```KeyClicked``` types?
  - [ ] would this be too convoluted? Elm likes clarity over complexity

### Maybe

Provided that a *polyglot API* (or separate different languages APIs) exist, these are a number of items I'd like add to the app:

- [ ] let user choose:
  - [ ] a different dictionary language
  - [ ] the voice language, params, and gender
- [ ] internationalization depending on dict language
  - [ ] help
  - [ ] commands
