# Speak & Spell in Elm

This is my very first attempt at an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app. I'm doing this to test my understanding of Elm and of my learning with ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action). I haven't finish the book yet and I could not resist trying to apply what I've learned so far.

I picked Speak & Spell because it's a good mix of UI/UX and it makes for a great starting point to learn and practice. It will never be more than a simple "*first project*" exercise. Being a *toy project* (no pun intended), it won't have too many features. I'll make it good enough to learn, and move on to resume my Elm learning path.

This is a limited reproduction of the original game: 1) match the word on the screen, and 2) use the commands. It won't have Mystery Word or other play modes from the original Speak & Spell. The point of this exercise is to: study, internalize, apply, learn some more, improve skills and code, rinse and repeat. Not to be an 1:1 clone.

## As Is

This exercise is over, for now. I've learned a bunch from it and went above and beyond the primary goal of understanding and internalizing Elm in Action's teachings up to chapter 5. I'd give it a 100/100 on that one.

Exploring elm-ui was also fun and interesting. Unfortunately, I realized that it's abandonware a little too deep into the exercise. Having said that, getting into elm-ui details and even doing a [bug fix](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui/issues/331) was priceless.

I decided to stop here, becasue of the cumbersomeness of making elm-ui responsive. Using [Device](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/Element#Device) functions or [derivatives of those](https://ellie-app.com/7R3Xv8m4rZRa1), was **almost** ok. However, to make it all work I should have modified the entire code base and that is beyond the scope of this exercise.

One day I'll resume this exercise and switch to elm-css elm/html to redo the UI/UX and make it properly responsive.

So long... and thank you for all the teachings...
