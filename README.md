# Speak & Spell in Elm

This is my very first attempt at an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app. I'm doing this to test my understanding of Elm and my learning with ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action). I didn’t finish the book yet and I could not resist trying to apply what I've learned so far.

I picked Speak & Spell because it's a good mix of UI/UX and as a starting point to learn and practice. It will never be more than a simple exercise. A good "*first project*" kinda thing.

The code certainly stinks, a lot. I’m well aware that it needs more love and that I could improve it. Which is the point of this exercise: study, internalize, apply, learn some more, improve skills and code, rinse and repeat.

## TODO

- improve stateful logic
- user keyboard input (with a native Elm keyboard input package)
  - visual feedback for the onscreen keyboard
- text to speech
  - webaudio? js port?
- UI/UX
  - look as close as possible to a Speak & Spell
  - CSS animations; visual feedback.
    - keys (vowels, consonants, commands to look different)
    - keys (do something when users type)
    - screen (flashy flashy)
    - feedback after checking the spelling and all that
