# Speak & Spell in Elm

This is my very first attempt at an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app. I'm doing this to test my understanding of Elm and of my learning with ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action). I haven't finish the book yet and I could not resist trying to apply what I've learned so far.

I picked Speak & Spell because it's a good mix of UI/UX and it makes for a great starting point to learn and practice. It will never be more than a simple "*first project*" exercise. Being a *toy project* (no pun intended), it won't have too many features. I'll make it good enough to learn, and move on to resume my Elm learning path.

This is a limited reproduction of the original game: 1) match the word on the screen, and 2) use the commands. It won't have Mystery Word or other play modes from the original Speak & Spell. The point of this exercise is to: study, internalize, apply, learn some more, improve skills and code, rinse and repeat. Not to be an 1:1 clone.
