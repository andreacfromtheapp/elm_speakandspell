# Speak & Spell in Elm

This is my very first attempt at an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app. I'm doing this to test my understanding of Elm and of my learning with ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action). I haven't finish the book yet and I could not resist trying to apply what I've learned so far.

I picked Speak & Spell because it's a good mix of UI/UX and it makes for a great starting point to learn and practice. It will never be more than a simple "*first project*" exercise. Being a *toy project* (no pun intended), it won't have too many features. I'll make it good enough to learn, and move on to resume my Elm learning path.

The code certainly stinks, and Iâ€™m aware that it needs more love and that there is room for improvement. That's the point of this exercise: study, internalize, apply, learn some more, improve skills and code, rinse and repeat.

## Try it

This very branch is a backup of the original Elm-only [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), you can try it here: [https://ellie-app.com/gh5X2czPkkxa1](https://ellie-app.com/gh5X2czPkkxa1)

## TODO

### stateful logic

- [x] make [Impossible States Impossible](https://sporto.github.io/elm-patterns/basic/impossible-states.html) ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
  - [x] managed certainty of ```type Status``` and ```type Output```
    - [x] Status: can only be Loading, Loaded ```something```, and Errored
    - [x] Output screen: can only show one line at the time, depending on user input
- [x] avoid [boolean identity crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TDKHGtAxeg) ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³
  - [x] see ```type Sound```

### keyboard

- [x] display keyboard onscreen
- [x] onclick events to output
- [x] onclick events to sound
- [x] use an [package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Gizra/elm-keyboard-event/latest/) to get user typing
- [x] get keycode from typing into onscreen keyboard
- [x] filter out KeyPressed to
  - [x] if alt/meta/shift/ctrl/repeat is pressed do nothing
  - [x] allow alphabet characters
  - [x] allow commands keyboard shortcuts
    - [x] ~~**FIX**: Sumbit It keyboard shortcut doesn't use the right word~~
  - [x] send keycode to screen (see "user feedback" section)
  - [x] send keycode to speak (see "user feedback" section)

### text to speech ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

- [x] [SpeechSynthesis Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) with a JavaScript Port
- [x] let user disable voice
  - [x] completely
  - [x] ~~for some features~~ **(no. API only pauses/resumes global state)**
    - [x] ~~just keys~~
    - [x] ~~just feedback~~
- [x] no need for Sub (for now?)

### refactor

- [x] refactor ```update``` and use helper functions
  - [x] reuse helper functions to streamline code
  - [x] declutter view's onClick events and use update for Msg
  - [x] not all Msg need to be parametrized

### output screen

- [x] ~~use a Maybe String for model.click to~~
  - [x] ~~show default message or GuessWord~~
  - [x] ~~implement a conditional to only show GuessWord if valid~~
  - [x] ~~awlays show clicked Nothing if GuessWord is empty~~
- [x] switch to using ```type Output``` with a ```case ... of```
  - [x] much clearer and less convoluted code
  - [x] it can either be Init, Holder, Word, or Result upon sumbit
  - [x] avoid double use of Maybe Strings that depended on one another
- [x] has user started entering a word?
  - [x] no: display default messasge telling the user what to do
  - [x] yes: display typed text
- [x] erase letter: if guess word is emtpy display default message
- [x] retry/reset: display default message
- [x] submit: result text to take over as the only text on screen
